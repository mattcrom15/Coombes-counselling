            <h1>Welcome, My name is Rachel</h1>
            <p>I’m a qualified counsellor with over 7 years of experience. I offer short and long-term talking therapy for adults online or by telephone. I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and work within their ethical framework.  
                
                I believe that every client is unique and that it is the quality of the relationship that is at the heart of successful therapy. Choosing a therapist is an important decision to make and it is easier to talk to someone that you trust and feel at ease with. It has been shown that change is much more likely to occur in a therapeutic relationship that feels safe, non-judgmental, and genuine. 
                
                To help you decide if I would be the right person for you, I offer a free 15-30 minute phone consultation, with no obligation and I’m happy to answer any questions. </p>
