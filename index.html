                <h1>Welcome, My name is Rachel</h1>
                <p>I’m a qualified counsellor with over 7 years of experience. I offer short and long-term talking therapy for adults online or by telephone. I am a registered member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and work within their ethical framework.</p>
                <p>I believe that every client is unique and that it is the quality of the relationship that is at the heart of successful therapy. Choosing a therapist is an important decision to make and it is easier to talk to someone that you trust and feel at ease with. It has been shown that change is much more likely to occur in a therapeutic relationship that feels safe, non-judgmental, and genuine.</p>
                <p>To help you decide if I would be the right person for you, I offer a free 15-30 minute phone consultation, with no obligation and I’m happy to answer any questions.</p>

                    <h1>Treatment approach</h1>
                    <p>
                    I trained in the Integrative approach to counselling and psychotherapy which brings together different elements of specific therapies. I take the view that there is no single approach that can treat each client in all situations but rather, each person should be considered as a whole, using counselling techniques tailored to each individuals need and personal circumstances. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     My counselling experience is varied with a diverse range of people and issues, including working with clients experiencing relationship problems, addictions, bereavement, and common mental health issues such as anxiety disorders and depression. I also have experience of counselling groups of people with emotional eating issues as well as a number of years working with those affected by gambling addiction.

                    <h1>What to Expect</h1>
                    <p>Our first free initial telephone consultation is quite informal and lasts approximately 15 – 30 minutes. This will be a chance for us to discuss your needs and reasons for counselling, as well as your expectations and what you would like to achieve from our sessions together including any goals you may have. </p>
                    <p>Once you have decided to go ahead with the therapy sessions we will arrange to meet on a regular day and time for 50 minutes either online or by telephone. I would usually advise weekly sessions to begin with as through my own experience and many years of research generally in the field of psychology it has been shown that the consistency of weekly sessions can give us better results. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That said, it is also completely your decision on how many sessions you require and how often. We will regularly look at where you are both in terms of your original reason for coming and in light of any other concerns that may have emerged. This will provide the flexibility for you to ensure you have the number of therapy sessions to fit your needs.
